- Database migrations managed by Liquibase.
- OpenAPI documentation via Springdoc.
- Sonar for static code analysis
- Continuous Integration and Deployment using GitHub workflows
- Containerized with Docker and ready for orchestration with Docker Compose.

## API

### Get Insurances for a User

```
GET /api/insurances/{personalId}
```

**Path Parameter:**
- `personalId` â€” The user's personal identification number.

**Response:**
- List of insurance policies for the user, including any applicable discounts, promotions, and (if available) associated vehicles.

**Example:**
```json
[
  {
    "insuranceOwnerNumber": "199001011001",
    "insurances": [
      {
        "insuranceNumber": "123456",
        "insuranceType": "Car",
        "insurancePrice": 90.0,
        "discount": 10.0,
        "insuranceStartDate": "2024-01-01",
        "insuranceEndDate": "2025-01-01",
        "insuranceStatus": "ACTIVE",
        "insuranceOwnerNumber": "199001011001"
      }
    ],
    "vehicles": [
      {
        "registrationNumber": "ABC123",
        "make": "Volvo",
        "model": "XC60",
        "year": 2022
      }
    ],
    "promotion": "Stockholm City Promotion - 15% off, valid until 2025-12-15",
    "source": "@vehicle-service"
  }
]
```

## Business Logic

- Discounts and promotions are applied based on feature toggles:
  - **Stockholm/Goteborg City Promotions:** 5% discount for users in these cities, with special promotion info.
  - **Black Friday Promotion:** Special discount and promotion info if enabled.
  - **General Discount:** 10% discount if enabled.
- Vehicle data is fetched from the `threadpilot-vehicle` microservice and included in the response if available.

  datasource:
    url: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/insurancedb
    username: threadpilot
    password: threadpilot
  jpa:
    database-platform: org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect
  liquibase:
    change-log: classpath:db/changelog/db.changelog-master.yaml

togglz:
  console:
    enabled: true
    path: /togglz-console
    secured: false
  feature-enums:
    - com.threadpilot.insurance.config.Features

vehicle:
  service:
    base-url: http://localhost:8081/api/vehicles/owner/
```

## Database
